## 1.0 Conformance Requirements Properties

### Background  

This effort was started in conjunction with the 1.0.1 release of the specification.  As a result of community efforts, some requirements changed as we reached version 1.0.2.  1.0.2 is the version that will be used for this Conformance Testing Requirements document.  Please consider this when using the document to map requirements.


### Requirements  

All requirements in this document are treated as MUSTs for conformance.  "If clauses" will be present in the case of conditional requirements.  If the condition is not met, this document makes no assertion of the rest of the requirement.  Every requirement in this document is self contained, no context can be inferred from other requirements in the document, even if in close proximity.  Thus, a requirement on "objectType" refers to all instances of "objectType", even if it appears near "actor" requirements.

### Tagging Types

Each requirement should take on one of the following types:

* Vocabulary - A specific string is expected
* Multiplicity - A certain number of an element or parameter is expected
* Type - A certain data type is expected
* Syntax - A certain format to the data is expected
* Structure - A certain order or hierarchy is expected
* Modify - An expected change based on inputs


### Tagging Syntax

Eventually every requirement will be numbered, but with this document in a state of fluctuation, we will finalize the list structure before assigning identifiers.  All properties and vocabulary specifically named should be in double quotes.

### Tagging References

All requirements will be tagged in this document by reference.  The reference will begin with the numeric section in the Experience API Version 1.0.1 Document in which it was found.  It will then use lower case letters to indicate which bullet within that section the requirement came from.  In the event there are more than 26 requirements in a single section, double lower-case letters may be used - aa, ab, ac, etc.  References that are not within a bullet will refer to .table#row#.lowercaseletter or .paragraph#sentence#.lowercaseletter.  External references should be marked with the requirement name (such as RFC 4122)

### Explicit Vs. Implicit

Each requirement will be tagged with a reference to the Experience API v1.0.1 specification.  If this reference contains a "MUST", it is explicit and will not be marked further.  If the requirement is assumed to be MUST because no other possibility exists or the spec itself isn't explicit, the requirement will be marked as **Implicit**.

### Assertion

In the event a requirement has been deemed necessary to add to this document, but has no current grounding in the xAPI Specification document, it shall be marked as "assert" and should have an accompanying issue in GitHub.  Resolution will take the form of a future change to the spec itself or removal of this requirement.

### Special Verbs
All requirements should follow the same basic verbs, some verbs, however, will require specific behavior.

* Rejects - Must be accompanied with an error code
* Is Defined By - Allows the definition of a new term to increase readability of requirements.  The definition 
links to a document section.  A specific requirement is not necessary.  Being "defined" doesn't remove any previous requirements i.e. an "Agent" is still either an "actor" property or "object" property.

### LRS vs. "System"

In the xAPI Specification, there are references to the Learning Record Store (LRS) as well as to a generic "system".  The LRS is not considered to be one of these systems for the sake of conformance as the LRS simply stores and retrieves statements, whereas "systems" referenced within the xAPI Specification are expected to perform either an additional task or a different task.  Requirements with MUST or MUST NOT that relate to systems will not be vetted in this document.  A similar case can be made for other non-LRS entities such as "Anyone".

### 2.3 Miscellaneous Requirements (Includes Activity Provider responsibilities to LRS)

## 3.0 Special Warnings

In the duration of time between xAPI version 1.0 and 1.1/2.0, certain issues were found that could impact conformance.  
The Conformance Test Suite behaves uniformally to all 1.0.X versions of xAPI, but some practices that were allowed in 
earlier 1.0.X versions were later found to be against best practices.  Such examples were deemed serious enough of a threat 
to interoperabilities to warrant warnings.  This section details those warnings.

*  An LRS SHOULD NOT reject a voiding Statement or Statement batch on the grounds that the "StatementId" property's 
value does not match any "StatementId" currently in the LRS.
